# Morse Code Translator using LabVIEW

This is the README for the Morse Code Translator VI and Python module code.
This project uses a conjunction of LabVIEW, LabVIEW's Python module and a Python script in conjunction with an accelerometer via myRIO's embedded device to convert vibrational accelerometer signals into morse code.

This is an open-source code that will be used for practical and simulation purposes. If you'd like to clone/add more functionalities, please fork and play with it. The only thing we ask is to give us credit and refer back to this repo.
